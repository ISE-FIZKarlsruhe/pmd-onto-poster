# pmd-onto-poster

This repository contains a prototype ontology of an ongoing work introduced by the poster paper:

```

Ontology Modelling for Materials Science Experiments. UNDER REVIEW.

```

**Note**: the prototype released by this repository is not the complete ontology developed by the *Plattform MaterialDigital*. The prototype is only used to discuss Materials Science and Engineering data curation, preservation, and enrichment by means of ontologies.


The *Plattform MaterialDigital* ontologies will be released through the official [github](https://github.com/materialdigital) of the project and advertized by the website www.materialdigital.de.


## Abstract
Materials are either enabler or bottleneck for the vast majority of technological innovations.  The digitization of materials and processes is mandatory to create live production environments which represent physical entities and their aggregations and thus allow to represent, share, and understand materials changes. 
However, a common standard formalization for materials knowledge in the form of taxonomies, ontologies, or knowledge graphs has not been achieved yet. 
This paper sketches the efforts in modelling an ontology prototype to describe Materials Science experiments. 
It describes what is expected from the ontology by introducing a use case where a process chain driven by the ontology enables the curation and understanding of  experiments.


## Example 

The *pmd-onto.ttl* file provided by this repository allows to reason with an example ontology in Protege to preserve material structures and properties that are not transformed by the processes. The image below sketches the example.
